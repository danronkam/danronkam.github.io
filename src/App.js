          "Heard was my first foray into developing as a team and I took on the role of lead front end developer. Given the one week turnaround, I also took it upon myself to implement agile methodology as the scrum master. In group settings, I highly value communication. Making sure my partners and I were on the same page about production status was not only key to getting our deliverables in on time, but making sure we stayed sane in the process. Daily stand ups, shared calendars of short term goals, and collective group sprints were some of the main methods I implemented. ",
          "Since Heard is somewhere between a confessional and mental health application, I knew we had a responsibility to present in a more professional manner for users. Inspiration came from leading mental health applications like Betterhelp, Calm, and more. From that I created mock up images to present in stand ups to involve the whole team in the process to create something we all can be proud of. "

In order to create messages then, the frontend must send in not only the content of the new message, but the topicId of the topic the message is affiliated with. Authentication middleware grabs the userId from the JSON Web Token (JWT). It is then populated with its topicId before the topic is found and updated by appending the message to its list of messages using findByIdAndUpdate(). Updating the titles title and / or mood or deleting it is simpler, involving mainly the findById and findByIdAndUpdate methods, since a new instance of a Message object does not have to be created.'},

It also provides safety for the user knowing no-one can edit confessions by them or edit their topic threads. Similar safety features are in place for all requests that involve editing or deleting a users content. The team felt that an admin user feature were important when creating an Anonymous platform so as to be able to hold those who chose to share irresponsibly accountable. Fun fun to code :)'},

Since this project was to be an exact clone of the Grailed, most of the design and functionality choices were already determined for me. To flex some of my creative muscles a little more, the images and animations featured on the homepage are my own. Some images are from photo shoots Iâ€™ve done for companies like Valentino, some are from my own grailed listings, and others are graphics made in the Adobe suite to show off current trends in menswear. ",

Previously I was limited by the boundaries set by the SaaS companies my employers were using. While websites like WordPress help anyone create a website, I would eventually hit a wall where I could not create the functionalities I wanted through their service and I knew I would expand my skill set to improve as a developer. Completing this project was a full circle moment for me as it helped to complete one of the goals I started App Academy for."

I never liked the randomized visualizers that became popularized in the late 90s to early 2000s, I wanted users to have control of what theyâ€™re seeing since theyâ€™re not selecting the playlist. The music selections are me projecting my music tastes on others. The current theme is, hotel-pool house music, but previously I put together playlists of Hawaiian soul music, an homage to Sophie, songs to feel sad too, plus others. "
